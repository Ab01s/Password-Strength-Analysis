# Password Strength Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project evaluates the strength of different passwords using an online password strength checker. The aim is to understand how password complexity affects security, identify common weaknesses, and document best practices for creating strong passwords.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) — Password strength evaluation tool

## 🔍 Process
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, length variations).
2. Tested each password using the password strength checker.
3. Recorded score, complexity rating, and tool feedback.
4. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
5. Researched common password attacks (brute-force, dictionary).
6. Summarized how password complexity improves security.

## 📊 Results Summary
| Password              | Score  | Complexity   |
|-----------------------|--------|--------------|
| Cant Skip These       | 100%   | Very Strong  |
| StOp_ThE_gEnOcIdE     | 100%   | Very Strong  |
| ab telegram1          | 37%    | Weak         |
| Scoreboard            | 33%    | Weak         |

## 📖 Key Learnings
- Longer passwords significantly improve security.
- Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases complexity.
- Avoid common words, dictionary phrases, or predictable sequences.
- Placing numbers/symbols in the middle of the password adds strength.

## ⚠ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words/phrases to guess the password.
- **Hybrid Attack:** Combines dictionary words with variations (numbers/symbols).

## ✅ Best Practices
- Minimum of 12–16 characters.
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid repeating patterns or personal information.
- Consider using a passphrase made of random words.
